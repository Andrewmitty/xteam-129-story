Once upon a time, A king named andrew sat in his castle awaiting his
knights. These knights had very important news and Andrew was getting
impatient. Eventually, Andrew went up onto the lookout to look for his 
knights. Days went by as Andrew continuted to wait, until one day a 
messenger woke Andrew up telling him they have arrived.

"Your Grace," said the messenger, "your knights have already returned
and settled down. It's great that you do not lose any one of them,
God be good. But..." 

"But what? What about the message I've been longing for?" The king went
a little agitated. 

"Uh, uh, I-I think you should witness this on your own, your Grace. 
Please! I really cannot believe what I saw!", cried the messenger, who
then accompanied King Andrew to descend the castle to welcome the knights.

To the king's amazement, the knights had discovered a time traveling wizard 
who came to greet King Andrew bearing gifts of Subway and Doritos.
The wizard admired King Andrew so much, he provided him with important information as to how to rule his kingdom.

Not surprisingly, King Andrew became not only the wisest but also the chubbiest king in all of history
from all the Subway and Doritos. The kingdom prospered and the people lived happily
ever after.

THE END.
